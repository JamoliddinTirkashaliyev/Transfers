          The ‘TopFootballTransfers’ website is engaged in predicting the
          transfer value of football players. <br />
          &nbsp; <br />
          Here, ‘transfer value’ of the football player means the amount of
          compensation for break/determine the ongoing employment contract with
          the football player. Club ‘A’ breaks the existing contract with a
          player, and club ‘B’ pays compensation. After that, Club ‘B’ signs a
          contract with the player. Clubs pay other clubs a lot of money for
          resign players? They want this player to play for them, and do not
          want to wait until the end of his current contract. In addition, big
          clubs sign more powerful players, meanwhile other clubs earn on
          searching and improving the skills of new players. <br />
          &nbsp; <br />
          How to assess a footballer's transfer value? <br> Skills and mastery of the
          player. <br> Player with the better skills costs more. <br />
          &nbsp; <br />
          The player’s age. <br> The younger player, the higher transfer value. The
          club pays compensation for the football player, to sign a new
          contract, and distributes transfer expenses on the new contract’s
          term. The less ‘possible’ term of a new contract, the less
          compensation clubs ready to pay. Also, young players can resign
          contract, and stay long enough in a club. Older players are often not
          at ‘the market’, and it complicate to return transfer expenses.
          Younger players have the potential to grow in skill and physical
          conditions. Older players more prone to injury and recurrence of old
          diseases. <br />
          &nbsp; <br />
          Contract’s Term. Expiry date of current contract’s term also depends
          on transfer value. If contract expires before the forthcoming transfer
          window, there is no transfer value. No reason to pay for a player, who
          during the next transfer window can be signed as free agent. If before
          expire of the contract there is only one transfer window (especially
          if it is a winter transfer window), transfer value will not high. More
          time remains before the end of the contract, higher transfer value of
          the player.The transfer value can be affected by other factors. For
          example, the transfer from the club of five top championships (Spain,
          England, Italy, Germany, France) is usually higher than the transfer
          of players from other championships. Transfer of players from
          non-European championships (except Brazil and Argentina) is often
          worth nothing. As example, Portuguese and Dutch clubs, signing free
          players from non-European championships (or from Northern and Eastern
          Europe) and sell them to big clubs. Big transfers committed between
          the top clubs. <br />
          &nbsp; <br />
          Other factor affecting to transfer value is the positive and negative
          media index/profile of the player. A footballer who does not get into
          incidents (especially criminal or sexual) is more reclaimed. On the
          contrary, players with negative media profile have a lower transfer
          value. Also influential agents (like Rayola and Mendes) can make clubs
          to shell out. Nobody wants to argue with an agent who has a lot of
          talented players in the wards, who in the future may need a club.
          Considering the above, do we have mathematical formula for calculating
          the player's transfer value? Nope. Prediction based on listed above
          factors, analyzing past transfers and monitoring trend of rising
          transfer market. Note that the transfer value indicated here does not
          consider the Chinese factor. Analyzing transfers of Chinese clubs,
          correlating them with the factors affecting the amount of these
          transfers, we could not find a connections. Just a few players want to
          go to play in China, so Chinese clubs are forced to overpay. In order
          to comply with Fair Play rules, some clubs resort to trickery, first
          they take a football player for rent, and at the end of the lease
          period they buy out the player. At the same time, the lease agreement,
          the transfer agreement and the labor contract are concluded
          simultaneously. Therefore, when taking into account the cost of the
          transfer, we add to the cost of the transfer the cost of rent paid for
          the player, if before the transfer he was rented from the club that
          carried out the transfer. <br />
          &nbsp; <br />
          In some cases, the clubs carry out future transfers, that is, they
          conclude contracts that this football player will be transferred to
          another club in the future. In this case, we already register the
          transfer in the section "Latest transfer" and transfer the player to
          the list of the club that carried out the transfer, although at that
          moment he can still play for the previous club. Another important
          feature of our site, the players are on the list of the club that owns
          their contract. They can compete for another club, but you can find
          them on the list of the football club that owns their contract. It
          should be noted that on our website the information (forecast) is
          posted only on top transfers, that is, about transfers amounting to
          more than 20 million euro. This is done because a large audience of
          football fans are interested in only major transfers and famous names.
          Little transfers between little-known clubs a few are interested.
          Also, it will be better for the site to work because our employees
          will monitor a limited number of players, which will promptly update
          the information. <br>
          &nbsp; <br />
          What is TopFootballTransfers.com for? To the fans was more clear information about the transfer costs of players. There are many sites that specialize in determining the value of players, but when making a transfer the amount indicated on these sites and the actual amount of the perfect site is highly divergent. This is because there is no concept of the market value of a player, a footballer is not a commodity. There is only the transfer value of the player, that is, the amount of compensation for breaking the contract. Also, you can not calculate the cost of the player for the coefficient of efficiency, mathematical formulas can not show the real picture, because in addition to the skill of the player there are many more factors that affect the transfer value. These factors can be more determinant than the skill level of the player. We rely more on consultations from football agents, as they are professionally engaged in transfers.
